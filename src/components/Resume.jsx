              At Human Resocia, I was dispatched to NTT Communications
              Engineering where I worked in system design as a software
              engineer. There, I was tasked with solving unique and challenging
              system integration issues. I used a variety of tools to develop
              new system architectures to achieve a flexible system that will
              meet our specific development needs.

              with Boise State's Facilities Operations and Maintenance
              department's small independent IT division. Due do Facilities
              Operations' unique needs, we, FOMIT, were a separate division from
